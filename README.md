# Workshop on AI and Hand on training

By participating in this workshop, you’ll:

•	Learn the introduction of AI and Deep learning and their basic building blocks. 

•	Understand the famous Neural Networks architectures like Artificial Neural Network, Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Networks.

•	Gain experience with common deep learning model such as Yolo, GoogleNet, MobileNet, ResNet and Generative Adversarial Network.

•	Learn to train a deep learning model for any use case (i.e, detect and recognize traffic on Highways) from start to end.

•	Leverage transfer learning between models to achieve efficient results with less data and computation.

•	Build confidence to take on your own project with a modern deep learning framework
