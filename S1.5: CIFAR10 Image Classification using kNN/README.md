# **Hands-on for AI Fundamentals Training at SDAIA (NCAI)**
# *CIFAR-10 Image Classification using kNN*

Performed k-Nearest neighbours clustering algorithm on the CiFAR-10 dataset to classify test images. Also performed k-fold cross validation to find the best value of the 'k' hyper parameter and best accuracy on the dataset.

## **Requirements**
numpy
matplotlib
Python version 3.5 or later 


## **Results**
The dataset was subsampled to prevent memory issues and only 10000 training samples and 1000 testing sampleds were used; the results from k-NN classification are:
- Best k = 10 
- Accuracy = 57%
